# river-geometry

Python implementation of R-Code CMGO to find the centerline and width of rivers based on the latitude and longitude of a right and left bank

## Data
Data is accepted as text file that is converted to a .csv script

```
     llat       llon      rlat       rlon
30.037581 -92.868569 30.119804 -92.907933
30.037613 -92.868549 30.119772 -92.907924
30.037648 -92.868546 30.119746 -92.907917
30.037674 -92.868536 30.119721 -92.907909
30.037702 -92.868533 30.119706 -92.907905
...
```

Left and Right Bank Latitude and Longtiude:
- Header: llat, llon, rlat, rlon
- Data in degrees

## Requirements
Currently running on Python 3.7+

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## Running Script

```python
python3 river_centerline_width.py 
```

Output: Latitude (Y-Axis) and Longitude (X-Axis)

## Algorithm
- Right and Left bank points are plotted (X-Axis for Latitude, Y-Axis for Longitude)
- Optional: Extrapolate between points to increase points 
- Generate a polygon to encapsulate the river between the right and left banks
- Generate a Voronoi based on the points along the river banks
- Display Voronoi ridge vertices that lie within the polygon (within the river banks)
- Filter out any point pairs that only have one connections to filter out the short dead end paths
- Iterate through points to find the longest path to filter out remaining small path dead ends

This is an attempt at a more robust algorithm working from raw data to ensure that all dead ends are removed and no gaps exist in the centerline
